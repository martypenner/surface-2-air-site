          I have been asked enough times regarding the progress on our next
          collection of songs to warrant the drafting of an update (at the very
          least). But I hope to do you one better and provide you with not only
          a status, but a motivation. As I say this, I am struck with the
          thought that most of you may not understand the full meanings of the
          things I will put to this page, however unfortunate, but I do feel it
          worth the effort.

          For starters Surface 2 Air is very much alive. We are in fact more
          alive and vibrant than ever. We have all passed our adolescents and
          moved into a very stable understanding of just what we hope to
          accomplish with our music. Although the other members may not be as
          vocal as I, we are none the less all in harmony as we meet our minds.
          We no longer feel an expectation to propel ourselves into the
          mainstream, we are in fact, free of all expectation and as such, we
          don’t suffer the consequence of disappointment. This in turn frees us
          to express the full scope of our thoughts and feelings. This one
          thing… is the greatest part of our transformation and on this one
          thing all others pivot and as such, all things will pass through it.

          The excitement we feel about the new sounds we are making is palpable.
          We have never pushed ourselves further and tested our skills more than
          now. We are literally writing beyond our ability. By that I mean we
          are learning how to play the things we are writing on the spot. We
          have never been a technical band and I will maintain that we are not,
          but we are definitely moving in that direction. This may excite some
          and disappoint others but we are evolving naturally and are not being
          pushed either way. With that said, it is safe to say that we are
          decidedly heavier than ever. We are choosing our sound carefully so
          that it is better capable of carrying our message, or more accurately,
          it is choosing us. Either way it is a very natural and organic
          evolution.

          Our approach to our lyrics is equally exciting. We are drawing as
          always from our lives and experiences but now very unapologetic. We
          are focused on providing an extremely honest journey and are now
          heading into some very difficult and taboo areas. What you will
          certainly find is a soul in every song that will resonate with the
          lives of those that are finding it difficult to fit in. I would find
          it safe to say that “emo” is not a fair description because “emo”
          music plays to ones emotions, trying to invoke them, when what we
          bring is not designed to do that but is only a resource in the
          process. I do not deny though that when one delves into such areas it
          won’t leave a mark. Or that it won’t sting when expressed, it’s just
          not designed to do that. We are focused only on the telling, the
          feeling on the other hand may come as a result.

          I would urge you all to keep us in your thoughts. This process may be
          taking longer than expected but I do think it is worth it. I hope this
          has excited you and that you are looking forward to hearing the
          finished product. Just be patient, because I think you all will like
          what comes out in the end.
