          A mixture of emo-metal and hard rock is probably not what you'd expect
          to hear from four guys who grew up in Mennonite homes. Frontman Corny
          Bartsch jokes that the music could be classified as "Heavy Menno", a
          lighthearted description of music in which both lucid melodies and
          rasping screams share a common space. Although they are from
          small-town southwestern Ontario, Surface 2 Air has grown a significant
          following by delivering consistently passionate performances and
          excellent quality recorded material, often traveling to nearby Toronto
          and to various international music festivals to perform. <br /> <br />
          2008 promises to be a busy year, with a new album and a string of live
          performances at clubs, festivals, and showcases planned. Their third
          release "Victory for the Dying" is set to hit stores early in the
          year. The band keeps busy performing and recording in the fully
          equipped recording studio that occupies much of lead singer and
          guitarist Corny Bartsch's house. Surface 2 Air likes to maintain
          control of their destiny as well as the quality of their recorded
          material. <br /> <br />
          As a band, they exhibit a work ethic and a dedication to their music
          that is uncommon in artists their age. Formed as a group of close
          friends, they are committed to both broadening the reach of their
          music and inspiring their audience. In their own words, Surface 2 Air
          was formed "on a foundation of broken spirits and searching hearts and
          has been driven by a desire to share our experiences in every song."{' '}
          <br /> <br />
          The entire span of their six-year history has been marked by a desire
          to play tighter, sound better, and deliver more passionately.
          Verifying these goals, world record- holding drummer Karl Fitzgerald
          Sloman remarked that they are "one of the tightest bands that I've
          heard in a long while." <br /> <br />
          Frontman Corny Bartsch is the primary lyricist, while lead guitarist
          Johnny Guenther also makes significant lyrical contributions to each
          project. When it comes to creating the music around those words, the
          band relies on a dynamic group environment that is both critical and
          supportive. There are certainly elements of bands like Tool, 30
          Seconds to Mars, and Linkin Park to be heard, but S2A has taken this
          style to another level with more musical diversity. <br /> <br />
          Lyrically, the band scours the depths of brokenness, and then rises
          from the darkness with the light of hope for the future. Because of
          this element of hope, there is more in common with the Psalms of the
          Bible than the utterly hopeless and narcissistic offerings of many
          bands who inhabit the genre. <br /> <br />
