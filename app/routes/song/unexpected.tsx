      <p>
        could you just imagine?&nbsp; <br />
        you are standing before the throne; it's happening.&nbsp; <br />
        could you just imagine?&nbsp; <br />
        your life has ended; things come to pass, just like He said.
        <br />
        <br />
        are you ready for what has to happen?&nbsp; <br />
        are you ready for the unexpected?
        <br />
        <br />
        there is no way to escape His coming.&nbsp; <br />
        there is no way to run away.&nbsp; <br />
        there is no way to escape His coming.&nbsp; <br />
        there is no way to run away.
        <br />
        <br />
        could you just imagine?&nbsp; <br />
        the moon gives no light; the sun is darkened; the stars fall from the
        sky.&nbsp; and i want you to just imagine.&nbsp; <br />
        the world is shaken; God is descending; and His are taken away.
        <br />
        <br />
        He's coming, there's no stopping.&nbsp; are you ready?
