      <h3>
        <strong>My Turn</strong>
      </h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        I walk in but it’s too late.
        <br />
        You’ve already said the things I hate to hear
        <br />
        And every day it’s the same thing.
        <br />
        The same old stories you’ve been tellin for years
        <br />
        Now listen to you, you don’t make sense,
        <br />
        You tear me up yet you say you respect me
        <br />
        So I’ll wait just another day,
        <br />
        I’ll wait for my turn to say what I gotta say
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’ve waited so long to tell you what is on my heart
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’ve waited so long and today my time has come
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’ve waited so long to tell you this is on my heart
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’ve waited and now it’s my turn
        <br />
        <br />I will not be the one to fall down and believe your thoughts
        <br />
        that constantly pierce my heart and leave pain within
        <br />
        Now that it’s my turn I’ll spill my heart and my mind
        <br />
        Hoping you’ll understand that you’ve been deceived
        <br />
        <br />I sit down with a dead face.
        <br />I show no emotion I know we can’t relate
        <br />
        And every day it’s the same thing
        <br />
        You hate to love yet you love to hate
        <br />
        Better watch it boy, now hold your tongue.
        <br />
        You’re an offense to God,
        <br />
        you don’t know what He’s done
        <br />
        And I won’t wait for another day,
        <br />
        Today it’s my turn to say what I gotta say
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All I want is that you believe me
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All I want is that you’ll see
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The real me
        <br />
        <br />
        I’ve heard it all a thousand times before
        <br />
        I’m all fed up with the latest news of yours
        <br />
        <br />
        I’ve heard it all
        <br />
        I’m all fed up
        <br />
        I’m all worn out
        <br />
        And I have had enough
      </p>
    </>
