      <p>
        I'm in that place again I couldn't soon forget the pain I felt that
        night.
        <br />
        Taken away my life there's nothing left inside, please still my beating
        heart tonight.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm every thing I hate, I failed to be what I need.
        <br />
        <br />I hate my life...no more to hide.
        <br />
        It makes me sick, as I live through it, prepare to die.
        <br />
        <br />I lie in the bed I made, bury me far away, no more I need the air
        I breath.
        <br />
        Save me from myself, I'm quickly loosing control.
        <br />
        <br />
        Stripped away, bare I lay, without eyes I see you clearly.
        <br />
        <br />
        Your breaking me...so I can see, I need you.
        <br />
        This pain I feel is sweet surreal, I can see tonight.
        <br />
        <br />I don't want to feel this pain inside...NOW I KNOW
        <br />
        what it feels like to lose my mind.
        <br />
        I'd rather feel this death inside,
        <br />
        than not to know what I'd be like to be alive.
      </p>
