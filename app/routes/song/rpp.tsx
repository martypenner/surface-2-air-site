      <p>
        You’re calling; i’m running away.
        <br />
        Because I’m afraid to hear.
        <br />
        I’m taking this plane to get me out of Your way.
        <br />I don’t want to interfere
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So many times I’ve tried and let You down,
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You call my name and I just turn around.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m too afraid to hear the words they’ll say
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don’t want to be afflicted,
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don’t want to feel the pain
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I try to hide, I try to hide my face
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet You’re there, You’re always on my case
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Detecting me; finding and pulling me
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outta my hole to go out and make a change.
        <br />
        <br />
        Don’t run away. He wants you to stay
        <br />
        Don’t be afraid. Don’t hide your face
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know I supposed to tell everyone about You
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The things You’ve done and You’ve been through
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How You lived; how You died on the cross
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking our sins away.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Showing Your love; showing You cared
        <br />
        <br />
        You can run but you cannot hide
        <br />
        Won’t take long for Him to find you
        <br />
        You can run but you cannot hide from God
        <br />
        You can run but you cannot hide
        <br />
        He’ll follow you the whole time
        <br />
        You can run but you cannot hide from God
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many times will I run and let you down?
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What will it take to pull me out of the ground?
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A smallest whisper that’s impossible to ignore?
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A limit of 40 days before someone loses their soul?
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The smallest things explode and scare me away
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it an excuse to say that I’m afraid?
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afraid to tell a stranger what You have in mind
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afraid of questions with answers I cannot find?
        <br />
        <br />
        I’m running like Jonah now I see what he ran from
        <br />I wonder, what will swallow me
        <br />
        You call me Your servant, yet I don’t believe it
        <br />
        I’m just a runaway puzzle piece
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are you running away?
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can’t you see you’re in His hands?
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you fear the hate of man?
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In their state they won’t remain
        <br />
        <br />
        What if they hurt me?&nbsp; What if they kill me?
        <br />
        What if they leave me here to die?
      </p>
