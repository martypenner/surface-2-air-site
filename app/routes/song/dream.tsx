        <strong>Dream</strong>
      </h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        I see an open door before me I step inside,
        <br />
        Never seen this room before or so it seems,
        <br />
        Fear and pain slam into me
        <br />
        <br />
        Frozen in my footsteps I look around,
        <br />I see a picture book laid bare, memories strewn about
        <br />
        Sorrow and rage course through me, I can’t believe its me
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No where to run, no where to hide,
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the things inside that try, to pry away my life
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So please, just run, just go away and let me fade
        away
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; holding close my pride
        <br />
        <br />I fall to my knees, what else can I do? Tears and blood mingled
        down
        <br />
        Stains cover me, I can’t be free, Escape. . . but where’s the door?
        <br />
        <br />
        Darkness surrounding me. It tries to snuff the lights,
        <br />
        Visions of all my fears, tell me I failed again.
        <br />
        I’m so enraged, I can’t contain the way I feel,
        <br />I beat my fists against the floor, I spill my blood
        <br />
        <br />I see a glimmer of a new faint hope, I let it come inside,
        <br />
        The life that I once lived I choose to leave behind
        <br />
        The hands that strangle me I. . . break free,
        <br />
        <br />A faint whisper calls to me, rest in me,
        <br />I believe it because I see the truth in it
        <br />
        welcome back from your dream or was it real . . .<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally somewhere to run, somewhere to hide
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some peace inside o God that keeps my hope alive . .
        . thank you
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So please just stop just stay awhile and let me talk
        to you
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’ll tell you all my dreams
      </p>
    </>
