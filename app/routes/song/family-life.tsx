      <p>
        you just turned sixteen and she's pregnant.&nbsp; <br />
        choices roll through your mind.&nbsp; <br />
        you can stay; you can run or the unthinkable.&nbsp; <br />
        this family is dead before it began.
        <br />
        <br />
        this is the fall of family life.&nbsp; we've seen it all.
        <br />
        <br />
        goodbye life; goodbye home.&nbsp; goodbye everything; goodbye
        forever.&nbsp; goodbye life; goodbye home.&nbsp; forever just seems so
        long.
        <br />
        <br />
        two women adopt a new born baby.&nbsp; <br />
        this kid will never know a father.&nbsp; <br />
        tolerance is breeding kids to fail.&nbsp; <br />
        is there hope yet left to bother?
        <br />
        <br />
        witness the fall of family life.&nbsp; we've seen it all.
        <br />
        <br />
        with every stroke of the pen, well, it happens again.&nbsp; <br />
        you can feel it like a knife rake across your skin.&nbsp; <br />
        once that pen drops it'll never be the same again.
