                  <p>Hey folks,</p>
                  <p>We have some exciting news and some sad news.</p>
                  <p>
                    First the sad; we will NOT be making it to the show this
                    Saturday, March 2nd due to some exciting news. Abe Miller
                    (bass player) just became a father on Tuesday to a handsome
                    little boy! It is difficult to apologize in a situation like
                    this so, we'll just make it up to you guys next time. In the
                    mean time, check out all the bands that are still playing on
                    Saturday.
                  </p>
                  <p>Thanks for understanding.</p>

                                <br /> <br /> We just wanted you to know that
                                we're still working on our new record and we
                                know, it's taking forever. We do have families
                                and full time jobs that top our priorities, so
                                bear with us.
                                <br /> <br /> Something new though...we will

                                "Victory for the Dying" and possibly the 2005 EP

                                place that distributes our music to places like
                                iTunes, Rhapsody, Napster and many more;

                    Hey all! It's been a VERY long time, and we've been busy. A
                    few changes have been made to the site. You can now check
                    out our discography page, with links to album covers and
                    song lyrics.. As well, we've finally put a short bio of
                    ourselves online, in case you care to hear a little bit of
                    history. Finally, we're starting a (small) blog with some
                    more personal reflections from each of us (I guess that's
                    what a blog is, right? :) ) And we've incorporated feeds
                    into all that so you don't have to go very far to get the
                    latest from us. See the links above to get started.

                  <p>
                    As far as music, we've been diligently hammering away at
                    some new tunes for the past while. Keep checking back for
                    more details in our first blog post (coming within next
                    week).

                      are working out all the details anyway and hope that
                      everything works out. We are looking at August 14th and
                      maybe a show on the 15th if we can get something together
                      in Saskatchewan or Manitoba. So if any of you are from
                      Saskatchewan or Manitoba and you want us to come to your
                      town, hook us up!!

                    We've got some new shirts coming soon! They should be ready
                    by the July 11th show in Vanessa. If all goes well, we are
                    thinking of doing a limited run of 4 designs that we've
                    made, so make sure you get a t shirt/hoodie! We will be
                    posting the upcoming design as an avatar for the Surface 2
                    Air group and fan page. Shirts will be going for $15.00, and
                    for the hoodies we might do a pre- order only since they are
                    more expensive to make.

                    Apperently, the city of London wants to tear down the
                    Embassy Hotel on Dundas St. and put up a 150 room
                    condo.&nbsp; What is London thinking?!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We have played some great shows there and seen greater bands
                    put on even greater shows and it's sad to see it come to an
                    end.

                    February 28th is scheduled to be the last night in business
                    and we will be there to put on one hell of a show ( with
                    your help of course ).

                    Hey everyone!&nbsp; S2A has got a new screamer!!
                    <br />
                    Our lead singer Corny, became father on Tuesday, the 13th to
                    his son, Samuel Cornelius Bartsch.&nbsp; He was born at
                    6:02pm and weighed 8 lbs and 14 oz.&nbsp; Corny’s wife
                    Annie, gave birth by “c” section and is recovering well.
                    <br />
                    On behalf of Corny, Annie and little Sammy; thank you for
                    your thoughts, prayers, gifts and visits.&nbsp; They are
                    very excited and can’t wait to see what little Sammy
                    becomes.

                  Hey folks, many changes have occurred over the past few
                  months, so we thought it a great time to update you on this
                  site about what's been going on :).
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Firstly, we've made some changes to the backend of the site to
                  make things MUCH easier to take care of, so you'll be seeing
                  updates much more often.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Secondly, we are holding off on performing for a little while,
                  as we are trying very hard to focus on our writing (it is VERY
                  different from what we've done before). But more importantly,
                  our lead singer (Corny, for those not in the know) is having a
                  baby any day now, so he's tied up for a bit. We expect to be
                  back to writing at the end of January, which is likely when
                  the next update will occur.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  We are also working on finishing the site, to be more of a
                  one-stop shop :). And of course, if you can't wait, you can

                  Well, after a long "break" from updates (at least on this
                  site), we've got some bad news: Surface 2 Air will not be
                  performing at the July 5 Norwich show in Dillon Park due to
                  Marty's fractured wrist. An unfortunate wipeout on the
                  racetrack has left him unable to drum for several weeks. But
                  all is well; recovery is good so far, so we hope to be back
                  soon.
