      <p>
        awakened by the sound of a new day.&nbsp; <br />i lie awake knowing
        exactly what is takes <br />
        to fight the laziness that once was mine; <br />
        to snuff the hunger and the deceiving lies.&nbsp; <br />
        before i rise, i see it in my head.
        <br />
        <br />i can feel it when you come around.&nbsp; <br />
        you keep on trying to steal what i found.&nbsp; <br />i can feel it,
        it's all around.&nbsp; <br />
        i've got the power to take you down.
        <br />
        <br />
        every day, Your ways are what i seek.&nbsp; <br />
        but it's a daily crucifixion of the old me.&nbsp; <br />
        this daily conflict between love and hate.&nbsp; <br />
        Spirit against flesh; i try to put off fits of rage.&nbsp; <br />i see
        myself crawling back inside of me.
        <br />
        <br />
        i'm sorry, it's got to be this way.&nbsp; i'm sorry, but you've got to
        leave!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get out!&nbsp; stay out!&nbsp; don't want you
        here!
