        <strong>These Clouds</strong>
      </h3>

      <p>
        Clouds of depression come over me
        <br />
        There seems to be no end
        <br />
        These clouds are always surrounding me
        <br />I wonder, where’s my Friend?
        <br />
        <br />I know these clouds only strengthen me
        <br />
        But still they drag me down
        <br />
        And giving up is so easy
        <br />
        These chains, they keep me bound
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where are You to help me now?
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where are You when these clouds surround me?
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suffocating me, choking me, and bringing me down
        <br />
        <br />
        You are the sunshine in the rain
        <br />
        You are the light rays reaching through the dark clouds
        <br />
        You are the sunshine in the rain
        <br />
        You take my broken life and make it whole again.&nbsp; Make it whole
        again
        <br />
        <br />
        You’ve helped me now, so many times
        <br />
        And I see there is an end
        <br />
        But these clouds constantly form inside
        <br />
        Like vultures they circle overhead
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These clouds, they come and go, making my life
        miserable
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But You are always there to change it
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your love helps me through, I know.&nbsp; But I
        forget and let it go
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus, take my life and change it
      </p>
