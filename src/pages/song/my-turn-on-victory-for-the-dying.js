      <p>
        Every minute you speak, you're spitting your hatred
        <br />
        but still I refuse to speak.
        <br />
        Every second you breathe, you're suffocating me,
        <br />
        yet still I pretend to breathe.
        <br />
        then I hear the voice spreading guilt through me.
        <br />
        When I hit the ground, my heart begins to bleed.
        <br />
        I'll admit it. The pain I'm feeling won't fall asleep.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm under attack, and I'm falling back again.
        <br />
        I'm under attack. The silence is breaking.
        <br />
        <br />
        I've been displayed for too long; the pressure is building;
        <br />
        the bottle is breaking.
        <br />
        It is time to move on and carry out my wicked desperations.
        <br />
        And I can't see how you didn't see this day coming,
        <br />
        when my sweet revenge (vengeance) is burning inside of you.
        <br />
        Still I'm waiting to feel the satisfaction but that day never came.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm under attack, and I'm falling back again.
        <br />
        I'm under attack. My white flag is rising.
        <br />
        <br />
        Your time's up, it's My turn. I'll show you a life full of hope for the
        lost.
        <br />
        You'll notice it's over. The enemy is dead, there's no one left to
        fight.
        <br />
        Just let Me take over and live your life this time.
        <br />
        <br />
        You were never meant to stand in front of Me, to take the hate.
