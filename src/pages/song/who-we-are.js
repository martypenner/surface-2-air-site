        you can't shut it out.&nbsp; <br />
        it's persistent, yet patient.&nbsp; <br />
        don't ignore the sound, of the Hand that's reaching.&nbsp; <br />
        <br />
        you can feel there's something going on.&nbsp; <br />
        you plug your ears until the voice is gone.&nbsp; <br />
        and you can feel that there is something wrong but it's so right, <br />
        it loosens what held you so long.
        <br />
        <br />
        He wants to know you.&nbsp; but He can't, <br />
        cuz you just keep shutting your ears.&nbsp; <br />
        He wants to know you.&nbsp; but He can't, <br />
        cuz you just won't listen!
        <br />
        <br />
        you can't shut it out.&nbsp; <br />
        it's persistent; and it's inviting.&nbsp; <br />
        don't hide yourself, from the Light that's reaching.&nbsp; <br />
        <br />
        and you can feel the warmth of the Son.&nbsp; <br />
        you hide away, you've lived in the dark too long. <br />
        and you can feel that this is something strong.&nbsp; <br />
        but you resist; in this black ocean you belong.
        <br />
        <br />
        He wants to know you.&nbsp; but He can't, <br />
        cuz you just keep hiding away.&nbsp; <br />
        He wants to know you.&nbsp; but He can't <br />
        cuz you just won't stand still!
        <br />
        <br />
        this is who we are.&nbsp; and this is His message.&nbsp; <br />
        would you listen?&nbsp; <br />
        this is who we are. and this is His message.&nbsp; <br />
        surface!
