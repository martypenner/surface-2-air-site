        <strong>Inside Out</strong>
      </h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        You're the cage that's locking away the obscene.
        <br />
        Tell me, can you feel it eating at the inside of your skin?
        <br />I can see your eyes are screaming the sound your mouth won't make,
        <br />
        because it's bleeding the secret you try to keep.
        <br />
        <br />
        How can you say that you're okay
        <br />
        when the only comfort you find, is isolating yourself inside?
        <br />
        Feed the fear. Tighten the chain. You play right into his hands.
        Exaggeration is the game he plays.
        <br />
        <br />
        The secret never goes away if you keep it inside.
        <br />
        It grows and grows until you can't handle it's size.
        <br />
        It never goes away if you run and hide.
        <br />
        growing, destroying until you live inside out.
        <br />
        <br />
        Your body aches; begins to break. It's got to find a way out somehow,
        <br />
        at the seams, your skin is ripping.
        <br />
        Initiate; open the gate,
        <br />
        before it explodes and destroys you in unwanted release.
        <br />
        <br />
        You're the cage that's locking away the obscene.
        <br />
        Tell me, has it still been feeding at the inside of your skin?
        <br />
        You're still hanging on to the fear of purchasing freedom; it's so
        relieving. But the price tag turns your eyes away.
        <br />
        <br />
        And watch them run and hide,
        <br />
        when you turn on the Light and give it wings to fly.
        <br />
        Then those wings become yours.
        <br />
        He won't remember, so just let it out and let it settle.
