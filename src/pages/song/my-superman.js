      <p>
        He can see through me, He can see through you
        <br />
        He knows what’s going on inside
        <br />
        He knows our thoughts, I know we were lost
        <br />
        And now we’re found and no longer blind
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He’s my man.&nbsp; He’s my Superman
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He’s the only One who could understand
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He took away the sins that were in my heart
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can trust Him because I know He’s the only One
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who knows what’s good for you and me
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And soon we will see, where we’ll be
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Together forever away from misery
        <br />
        <br />
        He carried mine and he carried yours
        <br />
        He carried our sins on His shoulders
        <br />
        He died for me and He died for you
        <br />
        And now we are His followers
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He’s the only Man I know who could be my hero
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He’s the only Man I know who could be my hero
