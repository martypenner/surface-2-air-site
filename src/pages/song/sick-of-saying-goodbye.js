      </h3>

      <p>
        I close the door, I get in and I drive away.&nbsp; <br />
        The moon is calling my name again.&nbsp; <br />
        And as I leave, I turn around and see your face <br />
        in the window as you smile and wave at me.
        <br />
        <br />
        This is the part I hate the most about loving you.&nbsp; <br />
        It's that it happens every time the day is through.&nbsp; <br />
        This is the part I hate the most about loving you.&nbsp; <br />
        It's that I have to leave and then we have to say goodbye.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm sick of saying goodbye.
        <br />
        <br />
        My heart is aching, the tears are falling as I cry.&nbsp; <br />I can't
        contain the hurt inside.&nbsp; I feel so lonely.&nbsp; <br />
        I'm so glad to be alive and I'm glad to know <br />
        you feel the same as I.
        <br />
        <br />
        Today everything is gonna change and loneliness is gonna fade.&nbsp;{" "}
        <br />
        Today everything is gonna change and <br />I won't have to leave and say
        goodbye.
        <br />
        <br />I won't have to say goodbye.&nbsp; <br />
        There'll be no more goodbyes.
