        <strong>Beautiful Mystery</strong>
      </h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        I’m amazed at Your wondrous ways.
        <br />I can’t explain or understand.
        <br />
        Half the things You say, aren’t so clear.
        <br />
        It seems as though You’re saving the best for later.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know we’ll never fully understand You while we’re
        here.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we know in part but one day we’ll see.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day we’ll see You face to face and it’ll all
        become clear to me.
        <br />
        <br />
        You’re a beautiful mystery, to me.
        <br />
        You’re a beautiful mystery, to me. <br />
        <br />
        The things You say are like what I see in the mirror.
        <br />
        After it’s all steamed from my hot shower.
        <br />
        I’ll wipe it away to reveal what’s underneath.
        <br />
        And You’ll do the same, revealing what I can’t see.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hold this mystery inside of my heart. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish to reveal this to the outsiders.&nbsp;&nbsp;{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        And You; Yourself, I can’t figure You out.
        <br />
        There’s so much of You that I just don’t know about.
        <br />
        Like, how You exist, where You came from and who You are.
        <br />
        And how You know what’s on my mind and see what’s in my heart.
