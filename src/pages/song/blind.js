      </h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Crawling and falling writhing in deceit
        <br />
        Fighting and crying remaining poor and weak
        <br />I can’t get myself to pray, too afraid of what He might say
        <br />
        I’d rather kill myself in pain than face the truth today
        <br />
        Personal retreat, keep the truth away from me
        <br />
        Sight beyond myself is far beyond my reach
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot see what I need to
        find ‘cause I’m . . .<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blinded, blinded, blinded, blinded
        <br />
        <br />I sit here beside myself I wonder who I am.
        <br />
        Silently observing what I say and do.
        <br />
        So what can I do? Can I take advice from you?
        <br />
        Please advise me on the most efficient route.
        <br />
        Partly cloudy skies. Maybe I could open up my eyes.
        <br />
        Tomorrow will be alright? Maybe . . . Maybe?
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I still can’t find what I’m looking for cause I’m
        . . .<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When God designed us,
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He wanted us to return to Him but we got lost on the
        way.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s not too late; step on the narrow way.
        <br />
        <br />
        Pretendin’ to be in love with God
        <br />
        Rejectin’ everythin’ he’s done so far
        <br />
        Defendin’ the sinful life you live
        <br />
        Believe it because the lies still think I can
