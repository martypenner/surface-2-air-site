        <strong>Waiting Room</strong>
      </h3>

      <p>
        I’m sitting here waiting, in this waiting room
        <br />
        Among this disease and among the doomed
        <br />
        <br />
        I’m sitting here waiting among the dying
        <br />
        The ones You’ve created, and the ones who’ve forgotten
        <br />
        <br />
        I’m sitting here waiting to be taken away
        <br />
        From this dark alley, from this cage of pain
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can’t wait to see my King coming down
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can’t wait to receive my golden crown
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can’t wait to see the dark clouds roll away
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can’t wait to see the day You take me away
        <br />
        <br />
        I’m watching and waiting for the last time I breathe
        <br />
        Not knowing the hour; waiting; unexpecting to see
        <br />
        <br />
        I’m watching and praying with Your Word in my hand
        <br />
        And Your Spirit within me, who helps me understand
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He helps me understand, who You are
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has shown the way from the start
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to this day I know, He’s a good gift
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He’s taught me who You are, and I’m waiting
        <br />
        <br />
        I’m waiting for my King
        <br />
        I’m waiting for my God
        <br />
        I’ve waited in this place
        <br />
        I’ve waited for so long
