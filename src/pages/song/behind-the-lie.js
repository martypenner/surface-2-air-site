      <p>
        Another tragedy has left you devastated
        <br />
        in a state of hating what you can't see or what you don't believe.
        <br />
        The question lingers and your mind just can't figure out
        <br />
        why our flame keeps burning on,
        <br />
        when all of us share the same wounds that bleed.
        <br />
        <br />
        Don't walk away this time tonight.
        <br />
        You know, you'll never find the answer if you don't kill the noise
        inside.
        <br />
        Don't walk away this time tonight, the answer you will find.
        <br />
        Just take a walk, it's waiting behind the lie.
        <br />
        <br />
        You long for that deafening whisper to call your name,
        <br />
        to relieve the suffering in your mind.
        <br />
        It isn't too late to find out, in silence, the quiet rings out.
        <br />
        It isn't too late, it's never too late. Please come back.
        <br />
        <br />
        Don't walk away this time tonight.
        <br />
        You know, you'll never find the answer if you don't kill the noise
        inside.
        <br />
        Don't walk away this time tonight, the answer you will find.
        <br />
        Just take a walk with me here behind the lie.
        <br />
        <br />
        It'll be alright. Everything is going to be alright.
        <br />
        Love is waiting. (don't be afraid, just jump right in. embrace this.)
        <br />
        <br />
        Just wait, be still, you'll find out why you haven't heard replies
        <br />
        from letters that you've sent with tears when you cried.
        <br />
        Don't walk away this time tonight, cuz you'll get your replies.
        <br />
        The answer you've been dying to hear inside.
