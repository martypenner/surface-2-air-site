      <p>
        as i work, i'm frowning.&nbsp; <br />
        you don't know what i've been&nbsp; thinking.&nbsp; <br />
        hands are shaking.&nbsp; heart is pounding.&nbsp; <br />
        mind is racing.&nbsp; thoughts are seething.&nbsp; <br />
        <br />i could run you down.&nbsp; i could tear you to pieces.&nbsp;{" "}
        <br />
        if i speak my mind i'll regret the thesis.&nbsp; <br />
        i'm fighting within myself; i don't want to hate you.&nbsp; <br />
        but you make it so easy.&nbsp; i'm not listening; go away.&nbsp; <br />
        <br />i don't care about you.&nbsp; you're so selfish and petty.&nbsp;{" "}
        <br />
        you don't hold the world on a string.&nbsp; wake up.&nbsp; <br />
        when will you ever learn?
        <br />
        <br />
        i'm so angry!&nbsp; and i can't believe i hate you.&nbsp; <br />
        and i'm burning.&nbsp; <br />
        the things you say, they bother me.&nbsp; <br />
        i've got to live with this.
        <br />
        <br />
        who can write a song for me so i don't feel so alone?&nbsp; <br />
        has someone been there before me?&nbsp; tell me, how do you atone?{" "}
        <br />
        how do i learn to love you?&nbsp; how do turn this inside out?&nbsp;{" "}
        <br />
        how will i live with myself?&nbsp; wake up.&nbsp; how can i love when
        i'm so angry?
        <br />
        <br />
        and do You love me?&nbsp; and do You love him too?&nbsp; <br />
        and You made me, just like him.&nbsp; <br />
        and why can't i see we're equal?
        <br />
        got to live with this
