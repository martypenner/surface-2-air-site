      <p>
        It's been a part of me for so long; to release, I can't seem to see.
        <br />
        But now I see the truth of who you've always been. Union begins to fade.
        <br />
        <br />
        Fill me up til I can't hear it's voice in my head.
        <br />
        Make an instrument of this dead shell I have.
        <br />
        I've tried and tried and I've always failed.
        <br />
        Would You take my place? It is Yours to take. I've had enough of this
        skin!
        <br />
        <br />
        Skin irritating me, corrupting what I believe about who I am.
        <br />I am free! It says, "I am not, can't you see that you're stained?"
        <br />
        You lie! It was never me!
        <br />
        <br />I hate it! It's tearing me to pieces.
        <br />
        When will I be rid of this skin I hate?
        <br />
        When will I be able to shed this skin I hate?
