        <strong>To Be Different</strong>
      </h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        You’ve fallen into routine What new stakes can you claim?
        <br />
        You’re living it over and over.&nbsp; Don’t you notice anything strange?
        <br />
        <br />
        Proud, smart, and independent.&nbsp; Deep inside, can you stand?
        <br />
        You’re weak and unstable.&nbsp; Can’t you feel you’re in his hand?
        <br />
        <br />
        What hope can you know?&nbsp; Your precarious state remains
        <br />
        Avoiding the obvious, compromising the truth
        <br />
        Tell me who, tell me what, will take the blame?
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be different, follow a new path.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Live your life unmistakeably odd
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be different, God can change you. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let Him move into that void
        <br />
        <br />
        Are you so different from the masses?&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
        Your righteous anthem is no different than the rest
        <br />
        Your new aged ideals aren’t so different
        <br />I find you boring, out dated. I suggest.
        <br />
        <br />
        Fill up with the Spirit, holy and just.&nbsp; It’s His gift.
        <br />
        For those who know Him, and are faithful,
        <br />
        are then freed from hedonistic traits
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will understand;
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (when) you thought you were different you were just
        the same
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will understand; <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you feel their hate, When you feel His love.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can be different, follow a true God
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Washing your stains in His blood and dirt
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crawl through your guilt and through your shame
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experience the life of His hurt.
