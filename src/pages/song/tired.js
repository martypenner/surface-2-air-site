      <p>
        I see you fall. Your face hit the ground again.
        <br />
        You've had enough of this carousel you're riding.
        <br />
        You feel the warmth of blood dripping down your face,
        <br />
        you're feeling weak, yeah you're tired of living this way.
        <br />
        <br />I wanted it to pass away;
        <br />
        knowing that blood would be dripping down My side.
        <br />I wanted it to fade away.
        <br />
        Can't you see that fear was ripping through My mind?
        <br />
        <br />
        You've never felt life cut this deep before.
        <br />
        The searing pain has left you feeling all alone.
        <br />I hear you crying out for something more;
        <br />
        another heart to make this easier to swallow.
        <br />
        <br />I wanted it to pass away;
        <br />
        knowing that this life would be leaving My eyes.
        <br />I wanted it to fade away.
        <br />
        Can't you see that this air was burning My lungs?
        <br />
        <br />
        The air is escaping. I'm tired of breathing. Can't bury this feeling.
        <br />
        You're not the only one.
        <br />
        <br />I drank from the cup anyway, so you wouldn't have to feel lonely
        tonight.
