      <p>
        there's something inside.&nbsp; <br />
        something only I can give away.&nbsp; <br />
        and i'll do my part with the strength of this Fire within.
        <br />
        <br />
        you think i'm falling; so you step inside.&nbsp; <br />
        you try to stop me by doing His part.&nbsp; <br />
        you think i'm falling; so you step inside.
        <br />i see your reason, but now you've gone too far.
        <br />
        <br />
        you step in front; try to stop, <br />
        my life seems messed up in your eyes.&nbsp; <br />
        you say i'm wrong.&nbsp; don't play with fire; <br />
        you'll burn, cuz i live by fire!
        <br />
        <br />
        there's something inside.&nbsp; <br />
        something only you can give away.&nbsp; <br />
        and now do your part.&nbsp; do the best I know only you can.
        <br />
        <br />
        my position you don't understand.&nbsp; <br />
        i'm so different; a different part of Him.&nbsp; <br />
        you think i'm falling; so you step inside. <br />i see your reason, but
        now you've gone too far.
        <br />
        <br />i don't tell you how to do what you do, so i leave you
        alone.&nbsp; <br />
        you tell me how to do what i do.&nbsp; why won't you leave me
        alone?&nbsp; I don't tell you how to do what you do. (i don't, i
        don't.&nbsp; NO!)&nbsp; <br />
        you tell me how to do what i do.&nbsp; why won't you leave me alone?
